# Tour of Go

This repository's purpose is to keep track of everything I've learned in the [**Tour of Go**](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1).  
Here, I’ll document code snippets, examples, and explanations to consolidate my knowledge and make it easy to refer back to key concepts.

Additionally, I am also including videos from the [**Go-Türkiye YouTube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@go_turkiye) as part of my learning process. These videos offer detailed explanations and practices in Turkish, and they complement the content from the Tour of Go.

You can find the list of videos in the [Go-Türkiye YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2txCMVbkjyqrdV5TsJ5iW-bhVNeBMaq).
